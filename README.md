# JosephKloepper_Flower_Spender
Final for CS - 100

-Project Goals-
  The goal for this project was to design and create a simple flower garden simulator using Python, pygame, and simpleGE. The idea is that the player clicks anywhere on the screen to "plant" a "flower" and earn points to unlock new colors at score milestones. My focus was on keeping the project achievable and functional, as I got overambitious with the original idea.

-Instructions for Players-
  Players can click anywhere on the screen to generate a "flower" with a random color and location. Doing so earns you one point. As your score increases, you hit score milestones (30, 60, 90, 12). Hitting these milestones will allow a new flower with different colors to generate on click. Score is displayed and updated in the top left, while the reset and store buttons are in the top right. Please note that the store button is currently a placeholder. Pressing the reset button clears your score.

-Technologies and Techniques Used-
  Language used - Python for programming the logic.
  Pygame for graphics and flower drawing.
  SimpleGE for scene management, labels, and buttons.
  Random module for generating the flower color and positions.
  Event handling for mouse and button clicks.
  Code documentation via notes and docstrings.
  Starting small and gradually adding more functions.

-Process and Reflection-
What I learned from this lab was primarily about how simpleGE and pygame interact and operate together, and the importance of keeping your program simple, creativity flowing, but not overly ambitious. "Wouldn't this be cool?" was definitely echoing in my mind for the entire project. I also got some extra practice in with doctrines and notes during this project.

-Where I got Stuck- 
I originally wanted to use clickable sprites that changed with each tap, and backgrounds that would change when a different score milestone was reached. Those features, alongside my store idea, were a bit overambitious in the first place and ended up using a ton of my time. Unfortunately, the simpleGE and pygame didn't work in my favor when I tried to implement these changes. Despite the various approaches I took, I eventually had to settle for what worked and left those extra features out of the final program. Although I did learn how pygame and simpleGE interact a bit better. 

-Where I'd like to Improve-
I would love to add those features I talked about in the last section. It would add much more gameplay depth. Ideally, I'd have sprites instead of colored dots as flowers. And I'd make sure the background changes with the scoring system. But the biggest improvement would be the addition of a store, with purchasable items. 

-What I would Do Differently Next Time- 
Simply know more about how coding logic works and fits together. I spent a long time thinking about what to do next and deciding what colors I wanted to use, and if my original idea was even possible. Next time, I would spend more time in the planning stage before moving into the actual coding.

-How far I Strayed from the Game Design Document-
Not super far, surprisingly. Some of the super cool features I wanted to implement didn't make it to the final, but the core idea of my game persisted. The creation of a multicolored flower garden.

-How I Stayed on Track-
I stayed on track by taking frequent breaks and breaking down my work into 1 or 1 1/2 hour increments. I felt much less overwhelmed, and it gave me the time to step back and look at everything with fresh eyes when I got stressed with all those roadblocks I hit. What also helped was focusing on what I did know, before trying to do something I was unsure about. Overall, I'm really glad we had the opportunity to express ourselves creatively and make something we can call our own. Thanks!
